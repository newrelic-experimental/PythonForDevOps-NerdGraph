# NRQL examples on The Four Golden Signals

The **Four Golden Signals** of monitoring are latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. If you can only measure four metrics of your user-facing system, focus on these signals.

NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. This **[link](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions)** explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions.

Use **[FACET](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-facet)** to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas.

NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types. Event data from all New Relic products, including:
- APM events, like Transaction
- Browser monitoring events, like PageView
- Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile
- Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample
- Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck
- Custom events, like those reported by the Event API

## The Four Golden Signals - Latency  

Returns the average response time since 7 days ago, group by - hourly

> SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'XXX' AND httpResponseCode = 'XXX' SINCE 7 days ago limit MAX FACET hourOf(timestamp)

Returns the 95th percentile response time since 30 days ago, group by - daily

> SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'XXX' AND httpResponseCode = 'XXX' SINCE 30 days ago limit MAX FACET dateOf(timestamp) 

## The Four Golden Signals - Traffic

Return the rate of change (1min) since 7 days ago, group by - hourly

> SELECT rate(count(*), 1 minute) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'XXX' SINCE 7 days ago limit MAX FACET hourOf(timestamp)

Return the rate of change (1hr) since 30 days ago, group by - daily

> SELECT rate(count(*), 1 hour) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'XXX' SINCE 30 days ago limit MAX FACET dateOf(timestamp)

## The Four Golden Signals - Errors 

Return the percentage of errors for status code 2XX since 7 days ago, group by - hourly

> SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode LIKE '2%') FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'XXX' SINCE 7 days ago limit MAX FACET hourOf(timestamp)

Return the percentage of errors for status code outside 2XX since 30 days ago, group by - daily

> SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode NOT LIKE '2%') FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'XXX' SINCE 30 days ago limit MAX FACET dateOf(timestamp)

## The Four Golden Signals - Saturation 

Return the average CPU since 7 days ago, group by - hourly

> SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE hostname LIKE '%XXX%' SINCE 7 days ago limit MAX FACET hourOf(timestamp)

Return the average MEM since 30 days ago, group by - daily

> SELECT average(memoryUsedPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE hostname LIKE '%XXX%' SINCE 30 days ago limit MAX FACET dateOf(timestamp)
